# FaceRecognition in ARKit

This is a simple showcase project, that detects faces using the Vision-API and runs the extracted face through a CoreML-model to identiy the specific persons.

## Requirements

* Xcode 9
* iPhone 6s or newer
* Machine-Learning model

## Usage
* sudo gem install cocoapods
* git clone https://github.com/wheelcomplex/FaceRecognition-in-ARKit
* cd FaceRecognition-in-ARKit
* pod install
* open faceIT.xcworkspace by Xcode 9

## Machine-Learning model


To create your own machine-learning model, you can read our blog post ["How we created our Face-Recognition model"](https://blog.novatec-gmbh.de/created-face-recognition-model/)

The short version is:

* We trained a model in the AWS using Nvidia DIGITS
* Took a couple of hundred pictures of each person, and extracted the faces
* Also added an "unknown" category with differnent faces.
* Used a pretrained model fine-tuned for face-recognition.
